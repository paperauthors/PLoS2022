Figure 8-a shows the average cumulative rewards over 100 simulation runs of Model 3 with partial replenishment under UCB policy, 
the model with hidden categories, 
where user clicks when they like the item and only the clicked items are replaced.
Importantly, the preferred categoties are hidden from the server. 

In this simulation, we assume that hidden categories are uniformly distributed among 100 categories 
and the initial reward of each category is 0.5.
and only a fraction, f0(a) = 0.5, of each category is the true preferred hidden category.  
The server serves 20 categories at each time step under UCB policy.

As a consequence, because the user exhausts only the category items, there is a natural depletion of the resources, until 
the fraction of items left is close to zero and both uniform and random recommender yield a near-zero instantaneous reward.
The parameter k which is used to approximate the depletion of resources is set to 0.01. Refer to equation (17) for details.

Figure 8-b shows the difference in reward between model 3 under UCB polocy and a random server under UCB policy.

At time step 200, the model 3 (UCB) server has the rewards of 2.45 and a random server 2.11, with a difference of -0.3422.
Figure 8 shows a similar pattern as Figure 7, even in the case that the learning has no initial bias, it is still no better than the random recommender.

Figure 7 and Figure 8 show that the bias behaviour is independent of the learning mechanism used to choose the recommendations.
