Run the simulations: run the following python simulation scripts:

python3 simulate_baseline.py
python3 plot_baseline.py

python3 simulate_divergent.py
python3 plot_divergent.py

python3 simulate_hidden.py
python3 plot_hidden.py


The simulation results are written to the npy folder; 
the subfolders m1/, clickon/, and hidden/ corresponds to the three models  
User Model 1, Model 2 of dissatisfied user, and model with hidden categories.
