Figure 2 is the sumulation for the aerage reward using the UCB algorithm.  The UCB algorithm chooses multiple arms among 100 categories at each time step to return 20 categiries of items(l).
At time step 200, the average reward reaches 13.56, which shows that UCB algorithm converges faster towards the limit.
