Figure 5 shows the result of a single simulation for the true cumulative reward of model 2 (Algorithm 2),
where categories of items are presented in a fixed order and users continue clicking until seeing a liked item. 
There are 100 categories, users are presented with 20 categories of items. In this simulation, user preferred category is 90, 
which is larger than the size of items served.
The true average (cumulative) reward (Rˆt/t), t = 1, . . . , T , where the server believes the average reward to be R˜t/t. 
The servers will gradually favour categories at the front of the list and eventually stops serving the user preferrd category 90.
The true reward would approach the value of zero asymptotically.
On the other hand, the server will account for all the clicks on items before category 90, resulting in a much larger server believed reward, with a limit of 20.

In the simulation, at time step 200, server believed reward is 19.89 while the true user reward is 0.06.
Figure 5 shows similar trajectory as the averaged results over 100 simulations in Figure 4-a.
