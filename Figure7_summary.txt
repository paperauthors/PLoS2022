Figure 7-a shows the average cumulative rewards over 100 simulation runs of Model 3 (Algorithm 3) with partial replenishment,
 the model with hidden categories, 
where user clicks when they like the item and only the clicked items are replaced.
Importantly, the preferred categoties are hidden from the server. 

In this simulation, the server serves 20 categories at each time step.
we assume that hidden categories are uniformly distributed among 100 categories 
and the initial reward of each category is 0.5.
and only a fraction, f0(a) = 0.5, of each category is the true preferred hidden category.  

As a consequence, because the user exhausts only the category items, there is a natural depletion of the resources
until 
the fraction of items left is close to zero and both uniform and random recommender yield a near-zero instantaneous reward.
The parameter k which is used to approximate the depletion of resources is set to 0.01. Refer to equation (17) for details.

Figure 7-b shows the difference in reward between model 3 and a random server where serving of items are completely random.
At time step 1000, model 3 has the rewards of 0.51 and a random server 0.5, with a difference of -0.0064.
Figure 7 shows that even in the case that the learning has no initial bias, it is still no better than the random recommender.
