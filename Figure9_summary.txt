Figure 9-a shows the average cumulative rewards over 100 simulation runs of Model 3 (Algorithm 3) with full replenishment, 
the model with hidden categories, where user clicks when they like the item.
Importantly, the preferred categoties are hidden from the server and items in all served categories are replaced.

In this simulation, we assume that hidden categories are uniformly distributed among 100 categories 
and the initial reward of each category is 0.5.
and only a fraction, f0(a) = 0.5, of each category is the true preferred hidden category.  
The server serves 20 categories at each time step.

With full replenishment, the resources do not deplete and the fractions of hidden categories remain constant.
As a consequence, there is a tendency to return to the mean rewards of value 10 given that each of the 20 categories has an initial reward of 0.5.
Figure 9-b shows the difference in reward between model 3 and a random server under full replenishment.
At time step 1000, model 3 has the average reward of 9.98 while the reward of the random server is 10.

Figure 9 shows that recommender of model 3 still perform less well than the random. Although it is
occasionally superior, this superiority is not persistent. Incompleteness of representation has 
led to failures of recommendation that the system cannot observe.
